Hello $FULL_NAME,

Your account on the ASPC server has been granted access to administer $SITE_SHORTNAME. The site folder is symlinked at ~/$SITE_SHORTNAME . (If you were already logged in via SSH, you will have to log out and log in again for the new permissions to take effect.)

For database information, consult ~/$SITE_SHORTNAME/config/database_credentials.txt and ~/$SITE_SHORTNAME/config/databases.txt

More documentation is available at http://peninsula.pomona.edu/docs/

If you have any questions, you can contact webmaster@aspc.pomona.edu

Your humble servant,
The ASPC System
